1. Pipeline Overview with NLP:
1.PDF Parsing: Extract the text from PDFs.
2.Summarization: Use NLP techniques to create domain-specific summaries.
3.Keyword Extraction: Implement traditional NLP-based keyword extraction methods.
4.Concurrency & MongoDB Integration: Ensure the system processes multiple documents in parallel and stores data efficiently.


```python
import fitz
```


```python
# A. PDF Parsing:
#Library: Use PyMuPDF TO extract text from PDFs.

file_path = 'C:\\Users\\Downloads\\Intern_mongoDB\\PDF\\250883_english_01042024.pdf'
def extract_text_from_pdf(file_path):
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    text = ""
    for page in doc:
        text += page.get_text()
    return text
```


```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize
from collections import Counter
```

B.NLP-Based Summarization:
Frequency-Based Summarization
Concept: We can use a frequency-based summarizer that selects sentences with the
highest keyword frequencies as the summary.

Steps:
1. Tokenize the document into sentences.
2. Compute word frequencies for each word (ignoring stopwords).
3. Rank sentences based on the presence of high-frequency words.
4. Select top sentences to form the summary.


```python

def frequency_based_summary(text, summary_ratio=0.2):
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words("english"))
    words = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    words = [word for word in words if word.isalnum() and word not in stop_words]
    
    # Calculate word frequencies
    word_frequencies = Counter(words)

    # Sentence Tokenization
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    sentence_scores = {}
    
    # Score each sentence based on word frequency
    for sentence in sentences:
        for word in word_tokenize(sentence.lower()):
            if word in word_frequencies:
                if sentence not in sentence_scores:
                    sentence_scores[sentence] = 0   
                sentence_scores[sentence] += word_frequencies[word]
                
    # Sort sentences by score and select top sentences
    num_sentences = int(len(sentences) * summary_ratio)
    summary_sentences = sorted(sentence_scores,key=sentence_scores.get, reverse=True)[:num_sentences]  
    
    # Join selected sentences to form the summary
    return ' '.join(summary_sentences)
```

C. Keyword Extraction with NLP:
TF-IDF Based Keywords
Concept: Use TF-IDF to extract keywords that have the highest significance within a document.

Steps:
1. Compute the TF-IDF score for each word.
2. Select the top N words with the highest TF-IDF scores as keywords.


```python
def extract_keywords_tfidf(text, num_keywords=10):
    tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=num_keywords)
    tfidf_matrix = tfidf.fit_transform([text])
    feature_names = tfidf.get_feature_names_out()
    return feature_names
```

D. Concurrency with Python:
Method: Use Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing or concurrent.futures to process PDFs in
parallel. You can spawn a worker for each document to handle parsing, summarization, and
keyword extraction.


```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
def process_document(pdf_path):
    text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)
    summary = tfidf_based_summary(text)
    keywords = extract_keywords_tfidf(text)
    
    # Store the result in MongoDB (placeholder function)
    store_in_mongo(pdf_path, summary, keywords)
    
def process_pdfs_in_parallel(pdf_paths):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        executor.map(process_document, pdf_paths)
```

E. MongoDB Storage:
Library: Use Pymongo to store the parsed data (document metadata, summary, and keywords)
into MongoDB.


```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

def store_in_mongo(pdf_path, summary, keywords):
    client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
    db = client['pdf_summary_db']
    collection = db['summaries']
    
    "pdf_path": pdf_path,
    "summary": summary,
    "keywords": keywords,
    }
    
    collection.insert_one(document_data)
```

F. Error Handling:Implement logging and error-handling mechanisms to catch and report issues like
corrupted PDFs or unsupported formats.


```python
import logging

def process_document_with_error_handling(pdf_path):
    try:
        process_document(pdf_path)
        print('test')
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error processing {pdf_path}: {e}")
```

3. Scaling and Performance:

a.Benchmarking: Measure the time taken to process PDFs of different lengths and optimize accordingly. For example, track memory usage and time per document, especially when processing concurrently.

b.Memory Management: Ensure you handle large documents efficiently by processing in
chunks where possible.


4. Innovation & Customization:

a.You can further innovate by adding your own heuristics for domain-specific keyword extraction, like identifying domain-specific terms manually or adjusting TF-IDF calculations based on a custom dictionary of terms.

b.Consider creating a lightweight GUI using Tkinter or a command-line tool to automate
the pipeline for users who want to specify PDF folder paths, output options, etc.


```python

```
